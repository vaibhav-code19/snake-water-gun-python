# Snake-Water-Gun 

A simple terminal-based Python game inspired by Rock-Paper-Scissors — but with a fun twist using Snake, Water, and Gun!

## 🎮 How to Play

- The player chooses:
  - `s` for **Snake** 
  - `w` for **Water** 
  - `g` for **Gun** 
- The computer randomly picks one of the three.
- The winner is decided using the following rules:

### 🧠 Game Rules
| Your Choice | Computer's Choice | Result     |
|-------------|-----------------|------------|
| Snake      | Water            | You win ✅  |
| Snake      | Gun              | You lose ❌ |
| Water      | Gun              | You win ✅  |
| Water      | Snake            | You lose ❌ |
| Gun        | Snake            | You win ✅  |
| Gun        | Water            | You lose ❌ |

If both choose the same, it's a draw .
